::Embedded MMC (eMMC) FAT boot::

Hardware modifications:
  To boot from MMC2 (eMMC) on 3630 Zoom3, the following modification has to be 
  made on the 3630 SOM:
  SYS_BOOT[5:0]: 110001            USB -> UART3 -> MMC1 -> MMC2

Notes:
  Once the hardware modification has been done, we can no longer boot from NAND.
  The only way to boot is either using MMC1 or MMC2. However, since NAND is 
  still defined we can save the environment in NAND.
  
  The eMMC is located on the main board on the Zoom2/3. Some are of size 8GB and
  some are of size 16GB.
  Examples:
  mmcblk1: mmc1:0001 STM08G 7.40 GiB
  mmcblk1: mmc1:0001 STM16G 14.8 GiB  

  If booting with an external MMC card in the slot, the kernel recognizes the 
  card as mmcblk0 and the embedded MMC (eMMC) as mmcblk1.

  If booting without an external MMC card in the slot, then the eMMC is 
  recognized as mmcblk0.

  If you insert an MMC/SD card at a later stage into the slot 
  (i.e. while the kernel is booting), it becomes mmcblk1.

  If booting with an external MMC card in the slot, make sure that the MMC2 
  interface support has been enabled in the kernel.
    To enable MMC2 support:
    # make menuconfig
      Device drivers --->
        <*> MMC/SD/SDIO card support --->
           [*] TI OMAP High Speed MMC2 Interface support

  Once the kernel boots and mounts the filesystem:
    # cat /proc/partitions
      179        0    1927168 mmcblk0
      179        1      72261 mmcblk0p1
      179        2     634567 mmcblk0p2
      179        8    7761920 mmcblk1

Booting from eMMC:
  In order to boot out of the embedded MMC (eMMC), we need to create a FAT 
  partition. To do so, we can run the fdisk utitlity after the kernel has finished
  booting. 
  Example: # fdisk /dev/mmcblk1
  Refer to this link for partitioning the eMMC:
  http://omappedia.org/wiki/SD_Configuration

  After creating the FAT partition on the eMMC, copy the MLO (x-loader) and 
  u-boot.bin (bootloader) images to it.

  To boot the kernel from eMMC, add the uImage to the FAT partition on eMMC.

  To mount the filesystem from eMMC, copy the file system to the ext3 partition 
  on the eMMC.

  To boot from eMMC, remove the MMC/SD card from the slot and reset the board.
  The x-loader logs will display "Starting OS Bootloader from eMMC ..." to 
  indicate booting from eMMC.

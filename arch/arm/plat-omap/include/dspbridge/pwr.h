/*
 *  ======== PWR_SleepDSP ========
 *      Signal the DSP to go to sleep.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *      sleepCode:          New sleep state for DSP.  (Initially, valid codes
 *                          are PWR_DEEPSLEEP or PWR_EMERGENCYDEEPSLEEP; both of
 *                          these codes will simply put the DSP in deep sleep.)
 *
 *	timeout:            Maximum time (msec) that PWR should wait for
 *                          confirmation that the DSP sleep state has been
 *                          reached.  If PWR should simply send the command to
 *                          the DSP to go to sleep and then return (i.e.,
 *                          asynchrounous sleep), the timeout should be
 *                          specified as zero.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      DSP_SOK:            Success.
 *      DSP_SALREADYASLEEP: Success, but the DSP was already asleep.
 *      DSP_EINVALIDARG:    The specified sleepCode is not supported.
 *      DSP_ETIMEOUT:       A timeout occured while waiting for DSP sleep
 *                          confirmation.
 *      DSP_EFAIL:          General failure, unable to send sleep command to
 *                          the DSP.

 *  ======== PWR_WakeDSP ========
 *    Signal the DSP to wake from sleep.
 *
 *  Parameters:
 *	timeout:            Maximum time (msec) that PWR should wait for
 *                          confirmation that the DSP is awake.  If PWR should
 *                          simply send a command to the DSP to wake and then
 *                          return (i.e., asynchrounous wake), timeout should
 *                          be specified as zero.
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      DSP_SOK:            Success.
 *      DSP_SALREADYAWAKE:  Success, but the DSP was already awake.
 *      DSP_ETIMEOUT:       A timeout occured while waiting for wake
 *                          confirmation.
 *      DSP_EFAIL:          General failure, unable to send wake command to
 *                          the DSP.

 *  ======== PWR_PM_PreScale ========
 *    Prescale notification to DSP.
 *
 *  Parameters:

 *    level:			The level of voltage domain
 *
 *  Returns:
 *      DSP_SOK:            Success.

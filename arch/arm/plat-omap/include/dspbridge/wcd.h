/*
 * wcd.h
 *
 * DSP-BIOS Bridge driver support functions for TI OMAP processors.
 *
 * Bridge class driver library functions, object definitions, and
 * return error/status codes.  To be included by Bridge mini drivers.
 *
 * Notes:
 *   Bridge Class Driver services exported to WMD's are initialized by the
 *   WCD on behalf of the WMD.  WMD's must not call module Init/Exit
 *   functions.
 *
 *   To ensure WMD binary compatibility across different platforms,
 *   for the same processor, a WMD must restrict its usage of system
 *   services to those exported by the 'Bridge class library.

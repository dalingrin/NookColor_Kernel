/*
 *  ======== CHNL_Close ========
 *  Purpose:
 *      Ensures all pending I/O on this channel is cancelled, discards all
 *      queued I/O completion notifications, then frees the resources allocated
 *      for this channel, and makes the corresponding logical channel id
 *      available for subsequent use.
 *  Parameters:
 *      hChnl:          Channel object handle.
 *  Returns:
 *      DSP_SOK:        Success;
 *      DSP_EHANDLE:    Invalid hChnl.
 *  Requires:
 *      CHNL_Init(void) called.
 *      No thread must be blocked on this channel's I/O completion event.
 *  Ensures:
 *      DSP_SOK:        The I/O completion event for this channel is freed.
 *                      hChnl is no longer valid.

/*
 *  ======== CHNL_Create ========
 *  Purpose:
 *      Create a channel manager object, responsible for opening new channels
 *      and closing old ones for a given board.
 *  Parameters:
 *      phChnlMgr:      Location to store a channel manager object on output.
 *      hDevObject:     Handle to a device object.
 *      pMgrAttrs:      Channel manager attributes.
 *      pMgrAttrs->cChannels:   Max channels
 *      pMgrAttrs->bIRQ:        Channel's I/O IRQ number.
 *      pMgrAttrs->fShared:     TRUE if the IRQ is shareable.
 *      pMgrAttrs->uWordSize:   DSP Word size in equivalent PC bytes..
 *  Returns:
 *      DSP_SOK:                Success;
 *      DSP_EHANDLE:            hDevObject is invalid.
 *      DSP_EINVALIDARG:        cChannels is 0.
 *      DSP_EMEMORY:            Insufficient memory for requested resources.
 *      CHNL_E_ISR:             Unable to plug channel ISR for configured IRQ.
 *      CHNL_E_MAXCHANNELS:     This manager cannot handle this many channels.
 *      CHNL_E_INVALIDIRQ:      Invalid IRQ number. Must be 0 <= bIRQ <= 15.
 *      CHNL_E_INVALIDWORDSIZE: Invalid DSP word size.  Must be > 0.
 *      CHNL_E_INVALIDMEMBASE:  Invalid base address for DSP communications.
 *      CHNL_E_MGREXISTS:       Channel manager already exists for this device.
 *  Requires:
 *      CHNL_Init(void) called.
 *      phChnlMgr != NULL.
 *      pMgrAttrs != NULL.
 *  Ensures:
 *      DSP_SOK:                Subsequent calls to CHNL_Create() for the same
 *                              board without an intervening call to
 *                              CHNL_Destroy() will fail.

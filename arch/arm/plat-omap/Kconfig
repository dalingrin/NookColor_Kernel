	  Say Y if you want to enable SmartReflex.

	  SmartReflex can perform continuous dynamic voltage
	  scaling around the nominal operating point voltage
	  according to silicon characteristics and operating
	  conditions. Enabling SmartReflex reduces power
	  consumption.

	  Please note, that by default SmartReflex is only
	  initialized. To enable the automatic voltage
	  compensation for VDD1 and VDD2, user must write 1 to

	  This option saves power, but assumes all drivers are

	  of which GPTIMER to use.  The historical default is GPTIMER1.
	  If CONFIG_OMAP_32K_TIMER is selected, Beagle may require GPTIMER12

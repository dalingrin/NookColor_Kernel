/*
 *  ======== MSG ========
 *  There is a control structure for messages to the DSP, and a control
 *  structure for messages from the DSP. The shared memory region for
 *  transferring messages is partitioned as follows:
 *
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------
 *  |Control | Messages from DSP | Control | Messages to DSP |
 *  ----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  MSG control structure for messages to the DSP is used in the following
 *  way:
 *
 *  bufEmpty -      This flag is set to FALSE by the GPP after it has output
 *                  messages for the DSP. The DSP host driver sets it to
 *                  TRUE after it has copied the messages.
 *  postSWI -       Set to 1 by the GPP after it has written the messages,
 *                  set the size, and set bufEmpty to FALSE.
 *                  The DSP Host driver uses SWI_andn of the postSWI field
 *                  when a host interrupt occurs. The host driver clears
 *                  this after posting the SWI.
 *  size -          Number of messages to be read by the DSP.
 *
 *  For messages from the DSP:
 *  bufEmpty -      This flag is set to FALSE by the DSP after it has output
 *                  messages for the GPP. The DPC on the GPP sets it to
 *                  TRUE after it has copied the messages.
 *  postSWI -       Set to 1 the DPC on the GPP after copying the messages.
 *  size -          Number of messages to be read by the GPP.
